# OpticalCommToolbox

This is the Optical Communications Toolbox from the Signal Processing Systems (SPS) group.

## Usage

#### Matlab requirements
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- Communications Toolbox
- DSP System Toolbox
- MATLAB Coder (+supported compiler)
- Parallel Computing Toolbox

#### Quick start
- Download or clone the toolbox from the [OpticalCommToolbox](https://gitlab.tue.nl/SPS_OpticalComm/opticalcommtoolbox) website.
- Run "Register_Toolbox.m"
- Run "Compile_Toolbox.m"
- The Toolbox is now ready, to start simulating either:
  - Run any example in the "Examples" folder from its respective folder
  - Copy any example folder to a location of choice to start building your own simulations

## Documentation

The documentation of the toolbox can be found in the [Wiki](https://gitlab.tue.nl/SPS_OpticalComm/opticalcommtoolbox/wikis/home) section.

## Git Client Setup

Any Git client suffices, but we recommend GitKraken, for which the install procedure is explained below. 

#### Installation

- Download the GitKraken client for your operating system [here](https://www.gitkraken.com/download).
- Install the software.
- In order to use GitKraken with the TU/e internal GitLab, a pro account is needed, which is available for free with a "**GitHub** (not GitLab!) Student Developer Pack".
  - Login to (or create) your GitHub account using your TU/e email.
  - Go to [this link](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/student_application) to start your GitHub Student application. Make sure you are either at the university or doing it from the TU/e VPN (GitHub uses location as one of the metrics for eligibility).
  - Select your TU/e email as the "school email address".
  - Use "Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e)" as the school name (should be auto filled from after selecting the email address).
  - Write something like "Research, internal simulation tools development" in the "How do you plan to use GitHub" field.
  - In the next step you need to upload a picture of your campus card.
  - After starting the application you should get accepted within a couple of minutes.
- Start GitKraken and use the "Sign in with GitHub" button after which a browser window asks to authorise the GitHub to GitKraken connection.
- You should now have the pro version of GitKraken.

#### Clone project
- Click: "Clone a repo" on the main menu page
- Click: Clone with URL.
- Select a suitable location for the project folder in "Where to clone to".
- Enter https://gitlab.tue.nl/SPS_OpticalComm/opticalcommtoolbox (or your repository of choice) in the URL section and click "Clone the repo!".
- Enter your **TU/e credentials** in the login section at the top, select "Remember me" and click "Log In".
- Click "Open Now" to open the repository and view the commit history.

## How to use Git
Git has a somewhat steep learning curve, but in the end it is a very powerful tool for version control.
Because git is a command-line tool at its basis, we recommend to use a graphical user interface for better ease of use and visualization (like GitKraken as recommended above).

If you want to learn more about Git and its usage, here are some useful links and guides:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc): Official Git documentation and useful introduction videos(recommended!).
